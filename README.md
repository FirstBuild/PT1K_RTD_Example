An example sketch using a 1K RTD and the Adafruit MAX31865 amplifier.

This example is just the example sketch for the Adafruit board with some
parameter changes to make it work with a 1K RTD.

The reference resistor was changed to 2.7K in order to work better with
the 1K RTD that we have here at [FirstBuild](https://firstbuild.com/).
