An example sketch using a 1K RTD and the [Adafruit MAX31865](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3328) amplifier.

This example is just [the example sketch](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MAX31865) for the Adafruit board with some
parameter changes to make it work with a 1K RTD.

The reference resistor was changed to 2.7K in order to work better with
the 1K RTD that we have here at [FirstBuild](https://firstbuild.com/).
